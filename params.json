  "body": "### Welcome to the webpage of our SSBSE 2016 Challenge Track paper\r\n## Searching for Configurations in Clone Evalution: A Replication Study\r\nWe perform a replication study using EvoClone framework (Wang, T., Harman, M., Jia, Y., & Krinke, J. (2013). Searching for Better Configurations: A Rigorous Approach to Clone Evaluation. FSE'13) by applying it to Mockito. We choose 4 clone detectors including CCFinder, NiCad, Simian, and Deckard for this study. Then, we perform an experiment on 14 Mockito major releases and report on the findings of optimised parameters and number of reported cloned lines.\r\n\r\n### Downloads the clone detectors' optimised parameters for 14 Mockito releases.\r\nPlease click [here](#) to download.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPlease contact @cragkhit for any inquiries.",
